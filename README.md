# Automatic-Question-Generation-in-Discrete-Math
Provided a framework for a new automatic generation of propositional logical questions in discrete mathematics with a difficulty control based on the user input.

Conducted an experiment involved 40 participants to assess the quality and difficulty of the generated questions. The total accuracy was 61.67%, which is similar to historical performance over the past 3 years.

Presented solid evidence for the feasibility of our generator, and affirmed that our approach has its potential to produce homework assignments with appropriate difficulty and quality.

If you are interested in this project, you could downloads all the files and create a python project to run it.

This project is Final Year Project by YANG Yicheng, WANG Xinyu, YU Haoming, supervised by Dr. LI Zhiyuan.
